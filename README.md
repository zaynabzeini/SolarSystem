Solar System Assignment - Overview

In this assignment, you will complete the Solar System Unity project, which will demonstrate
your understanding of the Unity editor, creating and positioning gameobjects, apply
behaviors, creating and applying materials, adding lighting and audio, adjusting cameras,
building the project, building the projects, and packaging it for sharing.

Instructions
1. Follow along with the lectures that accompany this lesson to build the basis of your
Solar System project.
2. Add at least three additional planets, such as Mercury, Venus, and Mars, complete with
materials, behaviors, and audio.
3. Adjust the position of the planets to be representative of a simple (partial) model of
the solar system.
4. Adjust the two cameras and the comet spawner, if necessary, so it looks how you want
it to look.
5. Optionally, feel free to make other modifications to your project, such as adding
additional objects to the scene. This is not required, but feel free to be creative, have
fun, push yourself, differentiate your project, and impress your fellow learners!
6. Ideally create Windows, MacOS, and WebGL builds of the project (but at least 2 out of
3). NOTE: For WebGL, make sure to select "Decompression Fallback" in the
"Publishing Settings" within "Player Settings" prior to building WebGL. Some
computer configurations have trouble building to WebGL, particularly if you use non-
English characters in your file structure. If this is the case, Windows and MacOS builds
will suffice.
7. Test that your build works. NOTE: Ideally you can test on all platforms but you should
test at least one (Windows or MacOS). NOTE: It is difficult to test WebGL games locally
due to security features in the browser. You can test WebGL once you submit the build
to itch.io below.
8. Create a ZIP compressed archive of each of the build folders. To create a zip archive in
Windows, you can right-click on a folder then select "Send To->Compressed (zipped)
Folder" from the contextual menu. To create a zip archive in MacOS, you can right-
clicking on a folder and then select "Compress" from the contextual menu.
9. Create a page on itch.io for your game.
10. Include a screenshot of your scene hierarchy with all parent gameObjects opened to
show your scene organization. If you need instructions on how to grab screenshots,
check out the reading that follows.
11. Include a screenshot of your project assets with all folders opened to show your
asset organization.
12. Include the builds created above. For Windows and Mac builds, make sure to select
"Executable" and select the corresponding platform. For WebGL, make sure to click
"This file will be played in the browser".
13. Include a description of the modifications made AND your game credits ("Created by
...").
14. Optionally include a cover image.
15. Set the "Release Status" to "Released".
16. Set the Pricing to "No Payment"
17. Save the page and click "View page"
18. Make sure the screenshots show by clicking on "Edit Theme" and set the
"Screenshots" layout to "Sidebar" and save.
19. Click "Edit Game" again and set the Visibility to "Public". You can also check "Unlisted
in search & browse".
20. Make any other desired modifications.
21. Save the page and then click "View page" to bring up what your players will see.
22. Submit the URL to your itch.io game page to the peer review assignment. You are
responsible for ensuring that you've submitted correctly according to these
instructions. Test your submission on another computer if possible.
